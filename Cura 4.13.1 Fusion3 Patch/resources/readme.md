Initial support for Fusion3 F410
Fusion3 does not openly support Cura as the slicer for their machine(s). These are the generic profiles for basic materials such as PLA, PETG, ABS, ASA, PC, PA, CPE and TPU.
The large majority of materials on the "Certified Materials" list, use these base generic files.
Please view https://www.fusion3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fusion3-Certified-Materials-List-updated-10.28.2020-Simplify3D.pdf
to identify which materials use a generic (F410-"nozzle size" - "material") type profile.

More profiles will be added at a later date.
